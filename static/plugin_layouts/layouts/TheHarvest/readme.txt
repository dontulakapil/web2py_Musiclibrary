Tips and Info
     
I supplied a blank header background (png) so you can render your logo, site name, and slogan over it. The main thing you need to keep in mind when you upload the files to your server is to keep everything in the same folder. You should have a main directory usually "public" with all the html pages, the css file, and a folder containing the images (structured just as it is in the folder you downloaded).

Important note: I have started to use conditional comments instead of the traditional hacks (* html etc.) to accommodate Internet Explorer's infamous flaws. That's why you have the extra style sheet named "iefixes". Only Internet Explorer will see that particular style sheet but it is nonetheless necessary. When I create new designs I try to provide Internet Explorer browser support back to at least version 5.5.        

If you get really stuck on something or need some help, contact me and I will do my best to help you out.

Good luck with your website.
